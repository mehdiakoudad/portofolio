## 📖 Project Overview
This project analyzes supermarket point-of-sale (POS) transaction data to extract **business and operational insights**.  
It answers key questions about:

- **Payment method trends** (card vs cash)  
- **Average spend per transaction** by payment type  
- **Impact of Sunday trading restrictions** in Poland  
- **Daily sales trends** and peak periods  
- **Staffing optimization opportunities**

The analysis blends **SQL** for data extraction with **Python** for visualization and storytelling, making it a complete retail analytics case study.

## 📊 Key Insights

1. **Card transactions dominate** slightly over cash, and card users spend more per transaction.  
   → Focus on card terminal reliability, card-linked promotions, and high-value customer targeting.

2. **Sunday closures** have **no negative impact** on weekly revenue — shoppers simply shift purchases to Friday/Saturday.  
   → Opportunity to save on labor and operational costs by closing on Sundays or shortening Sunday hours.

3. **Thursday–Saturday** are peak sales days: +25% more transactions and +40% more revenue compared to early-week.  
   → Adjust staffing, inventory, and promotions to align with peak patterns.

4. On open Sundays, **18–20 operators** are scheduled.  
   → Reallocating them to peak days could improve throughput or cut labor costs.
